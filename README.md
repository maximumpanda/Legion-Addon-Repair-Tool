# Legion-Addon-Repair-Tool
used to repair texture loading issues with the wow legion beta

**HOW TO USE:**

run the exe file in Legion-Addon-Repair-Tool/bin/release

enter the location of your addon folder (ie: G:\games\World of Warcraft Beta\Interface\AddOns)

wait for it to convert the files.

**this is a temporary fix** to the addon issues, please don't expect it to work forever and hopefully blizzard fixes tga loading so that this is not needed.
